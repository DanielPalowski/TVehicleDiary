I'm currently developing a real-life web application using C# ASP.NET Core MVC 8.0. It’s built with Entity Framework for database interactions and Identity for user authentication and authorization. Every piece of data in the system is tied to specific users, and I’m striving to make the application as stateless as possible so that it remains scalable and accessible to everyone.

As I progress, I'm planning to expand the project by building an API with JWT authentication, integrating Docker for containerization, and using Swagger for API documentation. Working with T-SQL and SSMS, I’m applying repository and service patterns to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.

This project is more than just code—it's my passion. I dedicate my free time to improving it, tackling real-world challenges, and learning new technologies. I’m constantly diving into Windows documentation, Udemy courses, and making the most of AI prompts—not to blindly copy code, but to truly understand and enhance my skills. AI has become an essential tool in modern development, and I use it strategically to maximize efficiency while learning as much as possible.
