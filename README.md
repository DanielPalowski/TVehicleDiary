-- Working on it RN --

I am currently developing a real-life web application using C# ASP.NET Core MVC 8.0. The application is built with Entity Framework for database interactions and Identity Framework for user authentication and authorization. Every piece of data in the system is tied to specific users, and I strive to make the application as stateless as possible to ensure scalability and accessibility for everyone. The project does not communicate directly with the database but is structured using Clean Architecture, where data is transferred between the application and the database through DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and view models via mappers. This ensures clean code and better management of data structures. The application uses Entity framework, Identity framework, Mappers, Repository pattern, Clean architecture, Dependency injection, SSMS, T-SQL, etc..

I plan to expand the project by building an API with JWT authentication, integrating Docker for containerization, and using Swagger for API documentation. While working with T-SQL and SSMS, I apply repository and service patterns to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.

This project is more than just code—it's my passion. I dedicate my free time to improving it, tackling real-world challenges, and learning new technologies. I am constantly diving into Windows documentation, taking Udemy courses, and making the most of AI prompts—not to blindly copy code, but to truly understand and enhance my skills. AI has become an essential tool in modern development, and I use it strategically to maximize efficiency while learning as much as possible.
